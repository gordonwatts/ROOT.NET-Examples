This solution contains some sample projects for ROOT.NET

Check out of github
Use a faily modern version of VS (2012 I suppose).
You'll need 2010 C++ installed on the machine for anything that requires direct builds!!

You'll also need the 2010 version of ROOT 5.34.14 (that is what this is built against).
